TODO
----
- loadResources:
    - needs to only have callback as first parameter
    - resources must be defined first once with BitmapResource classes
    - resources can invoke load instead to load a single resource when needed
    - resources can be defined later and loadResources can be called again to load newly defined resources
    - May need to maintain internal data structures
- tbd sprites and videos (for Sean to design spec)

* patches r here

- WEB FONTS!!!
    - CreateJS Text supports web fonts (the same rules as Canvas). The font must be loaded and supported by the browser before it can be displayed.
